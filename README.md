# Overview

Sagui is a cross-platform C library which helps to develop web servers or frameworks. Its core has been developed using the [GNU libmicrohttpd](https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd), [uthash](https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash), [PCRE2](https://www.pcre.org) and [GnuTLS](https://www.gnutls.org), that's why it is so fast, compact and useful to run on embedded systems.

# Features

* **Requests processing through:**
  * Event-driven - _single-thread + main loop + select_.
  * Threaded - _one thread per request_.
  * Thread pool - _thread pool + select_.
* **High-performance path routing that supports:**
  * Regular expressions using [PCRE2](https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2pattern.html) [syntax](https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2syntax.html).
  * Just-in-time optimization ([JIT](https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2jit.html)).
  * Binary search in path entry-points.
* **HTTP compression:**
  * [Deflate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE) compression for static contents and streams.
  * [Gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) compression for files.
* **HTTPS support:**
  * TLS 1.3 through [GnuTLS](https://www.gnutls.org) library.
* **Basic authentication:**
  * For standard login using *user name/password*.
* **Upload/download streaming by:**
  * Payload - for raw data transferring as JSON, XML and other.
  * File - for large data transferring as videos, images, binaries and so on.
* **Dynamic strings:**
  * Makes it easy strings operations in C.
* **String map:**
  * Fast key-value mapping.
* **And more:**
  * Fields, parameters, cookies, headers under hash table structure.
  * Several callbacks for total library customization.

# Examples

A minimal HTTP server example:

```c
void req_cb(void *cls, struct sg_httpreq *req, struct sg_httpres *res) {
    sg_httpres_send(res, "Hello world", "text/plain", 200);
}

int main() {
    struct sg_httpsrv *srv = sg_httpsrv_new(req_cb, NULL);
    sg_httpsrv_listen(srv, 8080, false);
    printf("Server running at http://localhost:%d\n", sg_httpsrv_port(srv));
    getchar();
    sg_httpsrv_free(srv);
    return 0;
}
```

The router support is isolated from the HTTP, so it can be used to route any path structure, for example:

```c
void home_cb(void *cls, struct sg_route *route) {
    printf("Home\n");
}

void download_cb(void *cls, struct sg_route *route) {
    printf("Download\n");
}

int main() {
    struct sg_router *router;
    struct sg_route *routes = NULL;
    sg_routes_add(&routes, "/home", home_cb, NULL);
    sg_routes_add(&routes, "/download", download_cb, NULL);
    router = sg_router_new(routes);
    sg_router_dispatch(router, "/home", NULL);
    sg_routes_cleanup(&routes);
    sg_router_free(router);
    return 0;
}
```

lastly, putting everything together:

```c
struct Holder {
    struct sg_httpreq *req;
    struct sg_httpres *res;
};

void route_home_cb(void *cls, struct sg_route *route) {
    struct Holder *holder = sg_route_user_data(route);
    sg_httpres_send(holder->res, "<html><body>Home</body></html>", "text/html", 200);
}

void route_download_cb(void *cls, struct sg_route *route) {
    struct Holder *holder = sg_route_user_data(route);
    sg_httpres_send(holder->res, "<html><body>Download</body></html>", "text/html", 200);
}

void req_cb(void *cls, struct sg_httpreq *req, struct sg_httpres *res) {
    struct sg_router *router = cls;
    struct Holder holder = {req, res};
    if (sg_router_dispatch(router, sg_httpreq_path(req), &holder) != 0)
        sg_httpres_send(res, "<html><body>404</body></html>", "text/html", 404);
}

int main() {
    struct sg_route *routes = NULL;
    struct sg_router *router;
    struct sg_httpsrv *srv;
    sg_routes_add(&routes, "/home", route_home_cb, NULL);
    sg_routes_add(&routes, "/download", route_download_cb, NULL);
    router = sg_router_new(routes);
    srv = sg_httpsrv_new(req_cb, router);
    sg_httpsrv_listen(srv, 8080, false);
    printf("Server running at http://localhost:%d\n", sg_httpsrv_port(srv));
    getchar();
    sg_httpsrv_free(srv);
    sg_routes_cleanup(&routes);
    sg_router_free(router);
    return 0;
}
```

For other systems, the packages `Source code (tar.gz|zip)` contains the library source.

# Building/installing

Check the [BUILD.md](https://github.com/risoflora/libsagui/blob/master/BUILD.md) for instructions to build the library, examples, tests and documentation, then, follow the steps in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/risoflora/libsagui/blob/master/INSTALL.md) to install the library from sources on your system.

# Compatibility

A typical upgrade of the Sagui library does not break the ABI at all. Take a look at the [API/ABI compatibility report](https://abi-laboratory.pro/?view=timeline&l=libsagui) to compare most recent library versions.

See also [Checking backward API/ABI compatibility of Sagui library versions](https://github.com/risoflora/libsagui/blob/master/ABIComplianceChecker.md).
